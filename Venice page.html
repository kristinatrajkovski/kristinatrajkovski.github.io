        <p>This is my favorite photo from Venice. It might not seem so special at first, but let me explain. One of my favorite books is Inferno by Dan Brown. As in all of his books, art and architecture pieces hold a key to a mystery. These exact horses represent one of the main keys in Inferno, and I cannot evet express my excitement when I saw them from the Saint Mark's Square in Venice, let alone come this close to them.</p>
